==========================

alias is a built in shell command that lets you assign name for a long command or frequently used command.

I uses ‘ls -l‘ command frequently, which includes 5 characters including space. Hence I created an alias for this to ‘l‘.

root@tecmint:~# alias l='ls -l'

unalias l
